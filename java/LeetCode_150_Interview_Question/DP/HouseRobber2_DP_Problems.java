/**
 * You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount
 * of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is
 * the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and
 * it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
 *
 * Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house,
 * return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [2,3,2]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are
 * adjacent houses.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
 * Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3]
 * Output: 3
 *
 * Complexity
 *
 * TC - O(n)
 * SC - O(n)
 *
