Reentrant Lock have below features(advantages) - (explicit locking in multithreading)
-Lock
-Unlock
-tryLock
-deadlock prevention
-lockInterruptibility
-fairness

disadvantages of synchronization-:

1> there is no guarentee of fairness
2> here indefinately blocking
3> there is no Interruptibility in synchronization
4> in synchronization we don't know which one is read locking and which one is write locking
